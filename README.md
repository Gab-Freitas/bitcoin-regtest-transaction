# bitcoin-regtest-transaction
This repository contains an implementation for creating Bitcoin transactions using Bitcoin Core RPC in regtest mode. The code creates a transaction with two outputs: a 100 BTC payment to a provided address and an OP_RETURN output with the message 'We are all Satoshi!!'. The transaction is created, broadcasted, and the txid is saved to a file.
